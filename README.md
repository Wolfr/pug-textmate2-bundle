# pug-textmate2-bundle

if you are one of the holdouts who is still using Textmate and codes in Pug, you will find that there are a lot of outdated bundles out there. I use this one which provides the correct syntax highlighting.

It's not perfect but it's the best I have. It's a modified version of an original Jade bundle.

I figured I would share on Github.
